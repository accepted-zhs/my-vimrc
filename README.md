# my-vimrc

Include some plugins, colorschemes.

You need to install `clangd` (needed by [clangd/coc-clangd]("https://github.com/clangd/coc-clangd")) and `nodejs >= 12.20` (needed by [neoclide/coc.nvim]("https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim")).

## Install nodejs

`nodejs` in official package repository of some Linux distributions may be very old. And `install_node.sh` in the repository can install `nodejs` on Ubuntu/Debian easily.
```bash
bash ./install_node.sh
```
