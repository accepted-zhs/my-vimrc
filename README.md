# my-vimrc

I made it for me only. Maybe it's not suitable for you.

Include some plugins, colorschemes.

You need to install `clangd` (needed by [coc-clangd]("https://github.com/clangd/coc-clangd")) and `npm` (needed by [coc.nvim]("https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim")).

On Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install clang clang-tidy clangd nodejs npm
```
